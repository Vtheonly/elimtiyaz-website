/**
 * Pricing Configuration domain — plan §"Administration".
 *
 * Hard rule: "All pricing must be configurable by administrators.
 *             Never hardcode payment values."
 *
 * The billing system reads amounts from this config — never from constants.
 * Adding or changing a price MUST NOT require modifying source code.
 *
 * Pricing is structured by category and qualifier:
 *   - Tuition: by granular grade level (prescolaire_1 ... 3eme_annee)
 *   - Transport: by named destination (ville_boumerdes / tidjelabine_sahel_figuier_corso /
 *                boudouaou_thenia_zemmouri / autres) — each with its own 3-tranche schedule
 *   - Registration: flat per academic year
 *   - Complementary services: psychology / speech therapy with semester & annual options
 *   - Additional services: free-form name → price (canteen, uniform, books, 2nd apron, clubs)
 *   - Discounts: named discount codes with percentage or fixed amount
 *   - Penalties: per-day late payment penalty
 *
 * Iteration 6 changes:
 *   - Tuition is now keyed by `GradeLevel` (14 grades) instead of `AcademicLevel` (3 levels).
 *   - Each grade level has its own 3-tranche installment schedule.
 *   - Transport is now keyed by `TransportDestination` (4 named zones) with per-destination
 *     3-tranche schedules — replacing the abstract T1/T2/T3 tiers.
 *   - 5 canonical discount codes per the official 2026-2027 schedule:
 *       * passage_palier — fixed −10,000 DA (grade-level transition)
 *       * seniority_5y   — 5% (more than 5 years seniority)
 *       * full_annual    — 10% (full annual payment before June 30)
 *       * highest_average — 10% (student with highest average in grade level)
 *       * sibling_fixed  — fixed −5,000 DA per additional student
 *   - Complementary services (psychology, speech therapy) with semester/annual options.
 *   - 2nd apron surcharge (2,000 DA).
 *
 * Backward-compatibility helpers (`tuitionForLevel`, `transportForTier`) are kept
 * but delegate to the new structure with sensible defaults.
