/**
 * Payment & Financial domain — plan §07 (revised in the Unified Financial
 * Architecture refactor).
 *
 * Payment methods: Cash / Check / Transfer (3 only).
 * Payment lifecycle:
 *   pending → partial → paid (or overdue / refunded / cancelled)
 *   pending_clearance — uncleared non-cash funds sitting on an installment
 *                        without yet satisfying debt (Invariant 4).
 * Non-cash requires proof scan (mandatory).
 * Tuition = 3 tranches OR 1 full-annual installment (per `paymentPlan`).
 * Transport = destination-based 3 tranches.
 * Discretionary Account Adjustments replace deprecated scholarships (§07.04).
 *
 * UNIFIED FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE (this revision):
 *   - `PaymentCategory` now covers every billable service in the platform:
 *     tuition, transport, canteen, uniform, books, extracurricular,
 *     therapy_psychology, therapy_speech, second_apron, parent_credit, other.
 *   - `Installment` now tracks `amountPending` (uncleared non-cash funds)
 *     separately from `amountPaid` (cleared funds) so tranches are NEVER
 *     marked "paid" by a check that has not yet cleared the bank.
 *   - `Installment` now carries `academicCycle`, `paymentPlan`, and custom
 *     schedule metadata so the schedule generator + UI can reason about
 *     the official `Prices.md` cycle rules.
 *   - `PaymentNavigationContext` + `PaymentLineItem` define the universal
 *     payload consumed by `UnifiedPaymentModal` — every payment entry point
 *     in the app (topbar bell, debt dashboard, parent/student drawers,
 *     installment grid, clubs, therapy, canteen) constructs one of these
 *     and hands it to the modal.
 *
 * `AcademicCycle` is imported from `./academic` (the canonical source) and
 * re-exported here so existing callers importing from `./payment` continue
 * to work.
