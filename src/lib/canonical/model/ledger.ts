/**
 * Ledger-based accounting engine — plan §07 (revised in iteration 5).
 *
 * PRINCIPLE: Every financial operation produces one or more immutable
 * `LedgerEntry` records. Balances are NEVER stored as a number — they
 * are ALWAYS computed by replaying the ledger. This guarantees:
 *
 *   1. Complete audit trail — every DZD has a traceable origin.
 *   2. Determinism — replaying the ledger always yields the same balance.
 *   3. No ambiguity — there is exactly one way to compute any balance.
 *   4. Reversibility — corrections are new entries with `reversesId`, never
 *      mutations to existing entries.
 *   5. Reconcilability — the sum of all entries' signed amounts is always
 *      equal to the sum of all account balances.
 *
 * ACCOUNT MODEL
 * -------------
 * Every ledger entry references an `accountId`. Accounts are scoped per
 * parent (and optionally per student) and per category. The account ID
 * is derived, not stored — it is `parent:{parentId}:category:{category}`
 * (or with `:student:{studentId}` when student-scoped).
 *
 * ENTRY DIRECTION
 * ---------------
 * A `LedgerEntry.amount` is ALWAYS signed:
 *   - Positive = debit (charge added to the parent's account — what they OWE)
 *   - Negative = credit (payment received or adjustment applied — REDUCES what they owe)
 *
 * The "outstanding balance" of an account = `sum(entries.amount)`.
 * A positive balance means the parent owes money.
 * A negative balance means the school owes the parent (overpayment / credit).
 *
 * ENTRY TYPES
 * -----------
 *   - `charge`         — tuition tranche invoiced, transport fee, additional service
 *   - `payment`        — cash/check/transfer received at the counter
 *   - `adjustment`     — discretionary credit (discount, waiver) or debit (penalty)
 *   - `refund`         — money returned to the parent
 *   - `reversal`       — negates a prior entry (linked via `reversesId`)
 *   - `transfer`       — moves value between accounts (e.g. reallocate a payment
 *                        from "unallocated" to a specific tranche)
 *
 * Each entry references a `sourceType` and `sourceId` so the UI can deep-link
 * from a balance back to the originating payment/expense/installment.
