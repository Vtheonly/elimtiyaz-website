/**
 * Payment sum helpers — single source of truth for summing payments and

 *
 * Extracted from `domain/model/payment.ts`:
 *   - `sumPaidPayments`        — sum of `amount` for payments with status "paid"
 *   - `sumInstallmentsDue`     — sum of `amountDue` across installments
 *   - `sumInstallmentsPaid`    — sum of `amountPaid` across installments
 *
 * Behavior preserved verbatim:
 *   - `sumPaidPayments` filters by `p.status === "paid"` (excludes pending/
 *     partial/overdue/refunded/cancelled). Use this everywhere the "total
 *     collected" / "total paid" metric is displayed.
 *   - `sumInstallmentsPaid` includes uncleared checks because `counter-payment`
 *     calls `installments.markPaid()` after `payments.collect()` regardless
 *     of payment status. Use this for tranche progress display.
